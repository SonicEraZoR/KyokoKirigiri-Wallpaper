# KyokoKirigiri-Wallpaper
 Project file of live wallpaper of Kyoko Kirigiri's introduction from Danganronpa 1 for Wallpaper Engine

## "Building"
Download/clone the repo. Copy "kyoko_introducti" to "Steam\steamapps\common\wallpaper_engine\projects\myprojects\" and then open the wallpaper in the Wallpaper Engine editor.

Alternatively, you can symlink "kyoko_introducti" directory to "<steam_path>\steamapps\common\wallpaper_engine\projects\myprojects\" so that you won't have to copy the folder back to your repo folder.

To do that:
* Open up your Command Prompt
* Change directory to "<steam_path>\steamapps\common\wallpaper_engine\projects\myprojects\"
* Type this to make a link: mklink /J "kyoko_introducti" "<path_to_repo>/kyoko_introducti"
